## Who? Me?
My name is Mohammad Abaeiani. 
I mostly appear as an anonymous user in most social media - where I talk a lot, and I decided to present myself a bit for those who actually saw my physical form.

## Academic/Professional
My first professional experience was graphic design, at high school I learned apps like Photoshop and Illustrator and made banners and posters for my school.
I took a brief internship as level designer back then as well (Amytis games)

I studied Electrical and Computer Engeering at University of Tehran, during this area I experimented in these fields as well:
 - Microcontrollers / Sensors
 - Signal processing
 - Web development
 - Mobile app development
 - Game development (mobile and PC)
 - AI development
I may add my CV somewhere in this website later. So, stay tuned fellow collaborators!

## Personal
I don't talk a lot in person. So even my close friends don't know everything about me!

My hobbies are mainy video games and watching movies/series.

I play LOL as an addiction and Indie games as a passion (You can contact me if you want to join me and my squad).

I am also open to activities such as hiking, I used to do it a lot with my friends.

A few of my qualities you might be interested of:
- I got identified as an INFJ twice (I don't actually believe that MBTI types are fixed)
- I'm an old soul
- I have a passion of creation (this lead me to follow a veriety of fields)
- I used to read a lot of philosophy and psychology books before getting busy with university
- I'm a metalhead and guitar player
