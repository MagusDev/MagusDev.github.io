# How Can We Help Autistic Children Through Games?

Serious games are a great way to teach children indirectly. In the specific case of autism, serious games can be utilized to enhance 3 main areas:

- Emotion Recognition: The ability to identify a certain emotion from a single subject or distinguish between 2 or more emotions

- Emotion Expression: The ability to express a certain emotion comprehendable for other people

- Emotion Regulation: the ability to choose and express appropriate emotion in a given situation.

The gameplay of our serious game will be divided into various scenarios based on the 3 stated criterias.

# Emotion Recognition: Single Subject Scenario

The most simple scenario for emotion recognition is asking the player to choose the objects which express a given target emotion. The gamplay of this scenario is like gamaes "chicken hunter" on nintendo DS and "Virtua Cop". There are many objects on the screen and the player should click on the correct object to gain points and clicking on wrong objects will lead to a punishment.

# Emotion Recognition: Multiple object distinguishing 

A more complicated scenario for training emotion recognition is distinguishing multiple objects and matching the ones with a common emotion. A well-known gameplay scenario for this task is card matching game. This game focuses on short-term memory training and the goal is for the player is to match all the pairs with the same image or color.

We modified the card matching scenario so that the player can match the common emotions in addition to full similarity. This way the player is encouraged to focus on the emotions for faster advancement in each set of cards.
